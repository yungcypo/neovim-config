# Neovim Configuration
This is the configuration that I use for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)  
I'm using [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) along with few other configurations  

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Neovim installed
    - `sudo apt install neovim` or `pacman -S neovim` or whatever suits your operating system
2. Clone this repository to `~/.config/nvim/`
    - `git clone https://github.com/yungcypo/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim`
3. *(Optional)* If you are using [wakatime](https://wakatime.com/)
    - After opening Neovim, enter the command `:WakaTimeApiKey` and follow instructions to enable WakaTime

For (possible) future updates, you can do the following commands
- `cd ~/.config/nvim/`
- `git remote update`
- `git pull`

> Note: Files (folders included) starting with `.`, such as `.config` are hidden in Linux. You can show them with command `ls -a`
